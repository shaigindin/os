FILES:
osm.cpp -- the source file which includes the functions osm_syscall_time, osm_function_time, osm_operation_time.
osme.h -- the Header for osm.cpp
graph.png  -- graph of the running time of the 3 functions running with parameter iteration=1000.
makefile - the makefile which generates libosm.a 

REMARKS:
No special remarks this time.

ANSWERS:

part a:
the program WhatIDo creates the folder Welcome and inside creates the folder To. 
inside the folder To it creates a link to a file name OS2020.
inside the file the app insert the string 
"mercydude\nIf you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!\n*"
when the start simbols the parmeter the app gets. 
if the app has no parameter it wont creates those folders and link.
after that, the app unlink OS2020 (delete the file) and remove the folders

part b:
in this part we use loop unrolling in two methods. 
1) we run the same command (for example function call) 10 times instead one in each iteration.
2) when we compile the file we use the flag -funroll-all-loops. this flag should  unroll all loops 
automatically without any efforts by the programmer.
